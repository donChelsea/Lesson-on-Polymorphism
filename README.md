# All my IntelliJ Idea Projects

** This is the README for all my IntelliJ Idea projects.

As requested, I’ve added an image for the README so it is more entertaining.

As you can see, I enjoy images of things in space. 

Most of my projects have 4 files, including a .gitignore file. 

If you need to pull this repo for any reason, please leave a request and we’ll get back to you asap. 

Sincerely, 

Management
